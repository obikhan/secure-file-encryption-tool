<h1>Secure File Encryption Tool</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
A Python tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using symmetric encryption with the cryptography library. The tool generates a unique encryption key, encrypts the contents of a file, and saves it as a .enc file. Users can also decrypt the encrypted file back to its original content with the provided key.

This Secure File Encryptor project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt files using the Fernet symmetric encryption method from the cryptography library in Python. The tool allows users to securely encrypt sensitive files, turning them into unreadable formats, and later decrypt them back into their original form using a unique encryption key. The project showcases basic concepts of file handling, encryption, and decryption, providing a simple solution for protecting file data.  <br/>
